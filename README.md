# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to analyze data from January to early May of 2019 for PyBer, a rideshare company. This is to be done using Matplotlib. The goal is to provide PyBer founder V. Isualize with an understanding of fare and driver metrics by city type, and visualization tools to help express these metrics.

## Results
Describe differences in ride-sharing data among city types.

The Summary Analysis in Deliverable 1 shows that:
- Rural cities have the highest average fare per ride and highest average fare per driver
- Urban cities have the highest total ride and driver count
- Urban cities have a much higher ride rate and a higher number of drivers than suburban and rural cities, however the average fare per ride and average fare per driver are much higher in rural cities than elsewhere. 
    - The average fare per driver is more than 3x higher in rural cities than in urban cities.
- Where there is a scarcity of drivers (drivers:rides), average fare is higher

## Summary 
Three business recommendations for the CEO addressing disparities among city types:
1. Try to keep scarcity of drivers in rural areas low: advertise incentives in rural areas encouraging people to become PyBer drivers. Driver scarcity could result in a loss of revenue and a frustration on the part of riders who are experiencing long wait times for a pickup. 
2. Research the average income for riders in the cities classified as "Rural" vs. "Suburban" vs. "Urban" and determine if average fare per ride/driver is too high for riders to afford. Affordability may be increased by adding more drivers as suggested in point 1. 
3. To address the low average fare per driver in Urban areas, it could benefit PyBer to do more research on why those numbers are so low by taking a look at the average amount of time spent on each ride, and distance covered. Maybe a study can be performed to algorithmically increase efficiency to decrease time between rides etc.
